   **Version 0.1.4 — Febuary 16, 2019**

 - Added manpage for fizmo-remglk.
 - Fixed autoconf detection for libremglk.
 - Updated tiny-xml-doc-tools to version 0.1.5.

---


   **Version 0.1.3 — September 3, 2017**

 - Renamed copyright files to “license” for github license detection compatibility, see [Github's “Licensing a repository”](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/) for further reference.
 - Added missing contributor phrasing to BSD-3 clause. The resulting license now exactly matches the wording used on Github and so also makes the license detection work.
